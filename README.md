# Flexoki Theme for Anki

This will change the default Anki card styles to use the Flexoki theme colors.

It works with the basic, basic reversed, cloze, and image occlusion card types. It also works with type in the answer cards. This will only change the colors of the cards not the layout.

## Installation

Copy and paste the [code](flexoki.css) into your Anki card template CSS section.

You can find this in Anki by going to the card type editor and clicking on the "Cards..." button. Then, paste the code into the "Styling" section of the card template.
